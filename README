About dbPager Server

The dbPager Server project provides the dbPager Language - the programming
language based on XML. The language is simple and understood well; it has
facilities to access and process external data quite easy, so it is an ideal
language for middle level logic implementation in multitier software complexes,
such as web servers.

The software implementations of the dbPager Language are:

- dbpager, the console language interpretator
- dbp_cgi, the interpretator as a CGI extension of the web server
- mod_dbp, the interpretator as an Apache extension module
- dbp_isapi, the interpretator as an ISAPI module (Microsoft IIS extension)
- dbpagerd, the application server

The sofware can be extended with plugins (dbPager modules). There are
out-of-the-box dbPager modules:

- dbp_odbc, the ODBC interaface to databases
- dbp_xml, provides XML features
- dbp_xslt, the XSL transformation feature

and community support resources.

Refer to INSTALL file to obtain installation instructions and doc directory
for software documentation and examples.
