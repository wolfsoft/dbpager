1. About dbPager Server

The dbPager Server project provides the dbPager Language - the programming
language based on XML. The language is simple and understood well; it has
facilities to access and process external data quite easy, so it is an ideal
language for middle level logic implementation in multitier software complexes,
such as web servers.

The software implementations of the dbPager Language are:

- dbpager, the console language interpretator
- dbp_cgi, the interpretator as a CGI extension of the web server
- mod_dbp, the interpretator as an Apache extension module
- dbp_isapi, the interpretator as an ISAPI module (Microsoft IIS extension)
- dbpagerd, the application server

The sofware can be extended with plugins (dbPager modules). There are
out-of-the-box dbPager modules:

- dbp_odbc, the ODBC interaface to databases
- dbp_xml, provides XML features
- dbp_xslt, the XSL transformation feature

Visit the web site at http://dbpager.sf.net for more information, downloads
and community support resources.

Refer to INSTALL file to obtain installation instructions and doc directory
for software documentation and examples.

2. Downloading and building dbPager Server from subversion repository

The dbPager Server project provides the subversion (SVN) repository with
latest version of the code at the sourceforge web site.

To build dbPager Server from repository you should have the following
developer tools installed:

- svn
- autopoint (version 0.17 or newer)
- libtoolize (version 2.2 or newer)
- aclocal (version 1.10 or newer)
- automake (version 1.10 or newer)
- autoconf (version 2.61 or newer)
- autoheader (version 2.61 or newer)
- xgettext (version 0.17 or newer)
- xsltproc

You will needed some of libraries installed (developer packages):

- libxml-2.0-dev
- libxslt-dev
- libpcre-dev
- libapr1-dev
- apache2-threaded-dev
 
Also you will needed the dbPager Classes Library, available from the
sourceforge at http://libdcl.sf.net.

To download latest dbPager Server sources, execute the following command:

svn co https://dbpager.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dbpager/trunk/ dbpager

The dbPager Server sources will downloaded into the dbpager directory. Next,
you should run the autogen.sh script in the dbpager directory - it creates
all necessary infrastructure to build the dbPager Server with developer
tools mentioned above.

After building the infrastructure complete, you should configure the
dbPager Server sources by running 'configure' script. The configure script
has various options, run it with --help parameter for details.

Finally, build the configured sources with 'make' command.

More information about building the sources can be found in the INSTALL file.

3. Known issues

The internal user sessions cache backend (the default; check dbpager.conf)
works only on multithreaded environment, so you can't use apache preforked
model. To use MPM model you should use the following apache configuration:

<IfModule mpm_worker_module>
#    StartServers          2
     StartServers          1
     MinSpareThreads      25
     MaxSpareThreads      75
#    ThreadLimit          64
     ThreadLimit         150
#    ThreadsPerChild      25
     ThreadsPerChild     150
     MaxClients          150
     MaxRequestsPerChild   0
</IfModule>

The key is one and only one server process. The memcached backend have not
any issues, so use memcached backend if you can.
