# This is the main dbPager Server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See the program documentation for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# The other dbPager interpreters use some of options from this
# configuration file too.

#
# cache = internal

# log directive

# address should be separated from port number with semicolon(':').
#
# For example: 127.0.0.1:9000, :9001
#
# Instead of providing network address, you can specify the unix socket path name
#
# bind = @UNIX_SOCKET_PATH@

# threads directive
#
# Specifies maximum amount of threads dbPager FastCGI Server should start to.
# The web server can accept several connections in one time, so this value
# limit the maximum number of concurrent connections to the dbPager applications.
#
# Optimal value is the number of processor cores * k, where k is 1..5 depends of
# your application. Starting with k = 1, try to increase the value until the maximal
# throughput stop increasing under heavy load.
#
# threads = 8

# user directive
#
# Specifies the user of process. Usually equals the web server user id.
#
