QUICKSTART
-----
'make examples' will build all examples programs. 

Run each of them with the -h command line parameters to get usage instruction.

exbin 
-----
Extracts e-mail attachments contained into input file(s).

You can extract just one type of attachment limiting the extraction to one
Content-Type using the -t parameter. 

Ex.
    ./exbin -t sound Mail/*
    ./exbin -t image/jpeg Mail/*

    This will extract all binaries, lots of virus and worms will be 
    probably extracted so be careful!
    ./exbin Mail/*

structure 
---------
Prints the MIME structure of email messages

b64 
---
Base64 encodes and decodes input files

qp 
--
Encodes and decodes in Quoted-Printable input files

catpart 
-------
This is a sort of standard Unix 'cat' program applied to email messages.

It searches for MIME entities based on command line parameters and prints
contents of those that match.

NOTE THAT -r MUST BE USED TO CONSIDER CHILD ENTITIES

Ex.
    prints the content of parts of MIME type image/* of email stored 
    in 'test.msg':
        ./catpart -r -t image test.msg

    prints just the name of files that contain image/* entities
        ./catpart -r -t image -l *

    prints entities whose Subject contain the word 'virus'
        ./catpart -r -f subject=virus *

buildidx 
--------
Create an index of files or directories containing email messages for fast
searches using the 'search' program.
Es.
    ./buildidx ~/Mail/* > my_mail.index

search 
------
Search for messages, try 'search -h' for parameters.
Use -I to use the index created with 'buildidx' to speed up lookup

mbox
----
It prints the MIME structure of each message found in a MBOX archive.
It's not very useful right now but it will be expanded :)
