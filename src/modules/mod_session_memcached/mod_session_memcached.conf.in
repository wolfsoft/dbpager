# servers directive
#
# The list of memcached servers to retrieve/store user session data, separated
# by commas. Network interface address should be separated from port number
# with semicolon(':'). If port number is omitted, default port (11211) is used.
# For example: localhost, 192.168.0.1:555, www2:555
#
# servers = localhost:11211

#
# ttl directive
#
# Specifies the session time-to-live in the cache (in seconds). This is a time
# of the user inactivity - each user request resets the timer and the session
# is closed when timer is out. Zero is the infinity.
#
# ttl = 0
